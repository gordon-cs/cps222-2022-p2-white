# cps222p2-starter-code

This is initial code for CPS 222 Project 2, plus related resources.

Copy this into your own repository.  Then implement the methods in
expression.cc, and add more tests to expression_test.cc.

Be sure to do a "git commit" as soon as you copy the files, so your
own work will be evident in subsequent commits.

reverse.cc and palindrome.cc are simply examples of using std::stack.
